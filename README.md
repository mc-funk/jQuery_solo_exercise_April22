##jQuery discovery solo challenge
based on: jQuery Peer Challenge 1

This repository contains a web program that generates random people and inserts each person as a new item in an unordered list. You can use the buttons at the top to generate people and clear the list of people. 

The "remove" buttons that appears with each new person will trigger a confirm sequence that prompts the user to either double click the remove button to remove, or cancel the delete process. 
 
It uses the following jQuery functions: 
* .empty(): removes all the children of the element. 
* .css(): modifies the css of the element. 
* .on("dblclick", function()): modifies the handler for doubleclick. 
* .closest(""): searches the parent chain for the closest element meeting the criterion in the string.
